parsing csv file, using tornado, sqlalchemy and apscheduler

this was the task itself:

We would like you to build a simple server for:

Reading the CSV every day

storing the updated data in a DB

exposing a single API to get a list of products by a producer. you should include some kind of pagination mechanism in your implementation


what I still need to do:
1. explain how to run it include the scheme part
2. instalation of dependency like via mysql server
3. pip packages (requirement.txt)
4. migration if there is
5 look at https://12factor.net/
